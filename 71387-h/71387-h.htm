<p class="dropcap">Some of the sketches constituting these Antiquarian
Gleanings were done before the idea of publication
presented itself: very soon, however, the author found
that objects of antiquarian interest were sufficiently numerous
in this Nor-Humbrian province to suggest the advantage of
going over the field, pencil in hand, and dedicating a small work to its
Ornamental Antiquities.</p>

<p>In following out this intention, the author has not confined himself
to any particular class of objects. In some cases Historical association
has determined the choice, in others the rarity of examples of the particular
kind of ornament illustrated, but in all cases it is hoped both
the connoisseur and the artist will find something worthy attention.
In one or two instances the objects may have been represented to the
public before with more or less fidelity, but when such are here repeated,
as in some measure necessary to enable the book when finished
the better to comprehend the moveable antiquities of the province,—other
matters of interest from the same locality, hitherto inedited, will
be found on the same plate.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate01">I.</a> <span class="gothic">Nautilus Cup, set in Gold with Cover.</span></h3>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg" alt=" ">
</div>

<p class="dropcap">This is a beautiful specimen of cinque-cento goldsmith work, preserved at
Corby Castle, the seat of H. P. Howard, Esq. M. P. Many specimens of the
Shell of the Nautilus, mounted in this manner, and all produced about the
same date are to be found; none of them, however, that we have seen,
exceed, or even equal the present in excellence of design.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate02">II.</a> <span class="gothic">Ivory Cup, set in Gold.</span></h3>

<p>The ornamentation of this cup is of the same date as the preceding. It is like the
Nautilus cup enriched with pearls and other precious stones, and its lofty cover is
surmounted by the figure of St. George killing the Dragon.</p>

<p>This beautiful cup is also the property of Mr. Howard, with whose family it is
historically associated, having been presented by the valiant admiral Sir Edward
Howard to Catherine of Arragon. At the Queen’s death it reverted to the Earl of
Arundel, and can be traced in the family ever since. During this long period it has
been called The Grace Cup of St. Thomas à Becket, and the legends and initials
upon it, which may have been retained from some earlier decorations, vouch for this
ancient and interesting tradition. Round the lid is the motto “<span class="smcap">Sobrii Estote</span>,”
with the letters T. B. supporting a mitre. Round the body of the cup is chased
“<span class="smcap">Vinum tuum bibe cum gaudio</span>.”</p>

<p>Round the neck of the top is the name GOD*FERARE, probably the name of
the goldsmith.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate03">III.</a> <span class="gothic">Antiquities in Jarrow Church.</span></h3>

<p>The Reading-desk is a rich example of Perpendicular, with waving Flamboyant
lines in the carving of some portions. From the introduction of these forms Mr.
Bloxam has inferred that it is not English workmanship. The Stone carving is very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
curious, most probably Norman, although it has peculiarities considered until lately
to belong to a still earlier date.</p>

<p>Of the chair of the Venerable Bede, little can be said. It has often been engraved:
is four feet ten inches high: made of oak. Its ornamentation has never been great,
probably not more than the following restoration exhibits.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="illus2" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus2.jpg" alt=" ">
</figure>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate04">IV.</a> <span class="gothic">Norman Book-Binding.</span></h3>

<p>This is from a MS. of the book of the Prophet Isaiah, with a gloss or commentary,
presented to the Prior and convent of Durham, along with others by Robert
de Adington, who is known to have lived about 1160, and preserved in the Library
of the Cathedral of Durham, to the present time. It is a leather cover without knobs,
those having been added in the etching as characteristic of the binding of that time.
It will be seen that the general design is completed by repeating the individual stamps
of which it is composed.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate05">V.</a> <span class="gothic">Relics of the Commonwealth.</span></h3>

<p>These have been preserved in the family of F. H. Fawkes, Esq. of Farnley
Hall. Cromwell’s sword is double-edged, straight and light, with quarter basket
steel guard. The sword of Sir T. Fairfax is a straight broad-sword with basket hilt:
on the blade is the name of the maker Andrea Ferara. Lambert’s sword is a hanger,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
serrated at the back; the hilt is brass; date on the blade 1648. The Watch is a
small repeater, bearing the name of the maker, Jaques Cartier: the outer case is of
leather perforated, and studded with silver. The matrix of the Seal is silver, and
inscribed “The Seale for the approbation of Ministers.”</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate06">VI.</a> <span class="gothic">Carved Chimney Piece in the Merchants’ Hall, Guildhall, Newcastle.</span></h3>

<p>This lofty and elaborate chimney piece is dated 1636, and is evidently of
Flemish workmanship. The large panels represent the Judgment of Solomon, and
the Miraculous Draught of Fishes. The upper frieze is composed of mythological
figures, and that below, immediately over the stone work, seems to be a representation
of the four quarters of the world.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate07">VII.</a> <span class="gothic">Norman Wall-Painting.</span></h3>

<p>This is a painting of the twelfth century (1154) on the side of a recess in the
Galilee, Durham Cathedral, formerly the Altar of our Lady of Pity.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate08">VIII.</a> <span class="gothic">The Same. The opposite Wall of the Recess.</span></h3>

<p>The soffit of the arch which connects these two jambs being decorated with
Norman foliage, and the wide back of the recess painted in imitation of hangings.
Whether these paintings can be properly termed Fresco—i. e. the colours applied
simply with clear water to the lime while wet,—is a question. They are more likely
distemper of a rude kind. The forms are expressed by a red outline; the spaces
within these outlines being filled in with colour, with little attempt at shading.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate09">IX.</a> <span class="gothic">Carved Chairs, and Flower Jar for the Wall.</span></h3>

<p>These chairs, the property of the Rev. G. Abbes, are of walnut wood, and very
excellent execution. The flower-jar is Dutch, of a kind of earthenware, judging
from the number of specimens remaining, much imported about a century and a half
ago. A vessel for the same purpose might be now manufactured with advantage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate10">X.</a> <span class="gothic">Carved Furniture.</span></h3>

<p>The Chair is one of a set, and very curious although rude: the figures most
probably being heraldic. The Cabinet is very choice in its ornamentation. They
belong to Dr. Charlton of Newcastle.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate11">XI.</a> <span class="gothic">Ancient Pulpit of Jarrow Church.</span></h3>

<p>The remains of this beautiful carved pulpit are in the possession of Mr. Rippon, a
zealous collector of carvings and antique furniture. It has been very small—less in
proportion to the figure than in our engraving it has been made to appear for the sake
of effect—indeed scarcely large enough for a man to stand inside. It is in the same style
of workmanship and of the same date as the reading desk given in a former plate (p.
III.) of this work.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate12">XII.</a> <span class="gothic">Small Stone Figures. Durham Cathedral.</span></h3>

<p>These figures are here given not only for the beauty of their action and drapery in
some parts, but as valuable illustrations of costume. They are about 20 inches high
under the canopies on the sides of the altar tomb of John, Lord Neville; 1389.
They were much mutilated by the Scotch prisoners, confined here after the battle of
Dunbar. The heads are here restored in order to complete the characters.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate13">XIII.</a> <span class="gothic">Carved Ivory Pastoral Staffs.</span></h3>

<p>The first and largest of these is a very choice specimen of Ivory carving. It has
been elaborately illuminated, but the colors are now nearly worn off. Over the head
of our Saviour there has probably been a canopy of precious metal now gone, the
supports only remaining. On each side of Christ are small angels in white dresses,
decorated with gold fleur-de-lys, bearing the instruments of crucifixion, and the
saints rising out of their graves are seen in the ornament under one of these angels.
The figures round the lower part are the twelve apostles. Between this lower part
and the top some ornament has intervened, as socket holes in the ivory show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>The other side is similar to the one given, only the Virgin and child take the place
of the single figure of our Saviour. Date 1300 to 1320. It is in the possession of P.
H. Howard, Esquire, M. P. The smaller and plainer specimen is in the Museum of
Newcastle, and is a good deal earlier in date than the former.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate14">XIV.</a> <span class="gothic">Antiquities at Hexham, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>1. The Frith-Stool or Seat of Peace, of the Sanctuary of Hexham. “There were
four crosses set up at a certain distance from the church, in the four ways leading
thereto, within which the whole town of Hexham was included. If a malefactor
flying for refuge was taken within these crosses but without the town, the arresting
party forfeited 200, a sum probably represented by £10. If within the town, 600;
within the walls of the church-yard, 600; within the Church, 1200; within the choir,
1800; but if the pursuer dared to take the fugitive from the <span class="smcap">Frith-Stool</span>, or from
among the holy relics behind the altar, the offence was beyond redemption.” <i>W. Sidney
Gibson.</i></p>

<p>2. Early English ornaments on the arcade in the Transept: Hexham Church.</p>

<p>3. Asperging vessel of copper. Now in Wreay Church, Cumberland, having been
presented by Miss Losh of Woodside, who designed and principally built that beautiful
and curious little church. The legend round the lip is as follows. † Pries. Pur.
Lalme. G. Glanuille. †</p>

<p>4. Two keys in the possession of Mr. Rippon. The small one was found in Tynemouth
ruins, the large one is that of the former church of Gateshead: it is near a
foot in length, and furnished with a series of staples.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate15">XV.</a> <span class="gothic">Antiquities in York Minster.</span></h3>

<p>The horn of Ulphus is about 2 feet and a half in length. By means of it Ulphus,
a Danish nobleman of the time of Canute enfeoffed the church with his lands and
revenues. It was sold to a goldsmith during the Civil war, and was returned to the
church by the Fairfax family, to which event the inscription on the silver hoop refers.</p>

<p>2. The Cordwainer’s Bowl, commonly said to have been given to the cordwainers
by Archbishop Scrope, who was beheaded for rebellion in 1405. It seems however
more probable that it originally belonged to the guild of Corpus Christi at York,
having been given to them by Agnes Wyman who died in 1413. This Bowl had
the valuable privilege attached to it of granting indulgences, as the inscription round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
it describes. “Recharde, arche becchope Scrope grant onto all tho that drinkis of
this cope xl dayis to pardun. Robart Gobsim Becchope mosm [?] grant ye same for me
a fore saide xl dayes to pardun. Robart Strensall.” It was presented to the Cathedral
on the breaking up of the Guild: 1808. It holds 4½ quarts, wine measure, and is
38½ inches circumference. See “Proceedings of the Archæological Institute at York.”</p>

<p>The ancient tiles were found to have been part of the early floor of the Chapter
House.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate16">XVI.</a> <span class="gothic">Ancient Crucifix.</span></h3>

<p>This relic is a good specimen of the work of the early enamellers of Limoges. The
Byzantine origin of this school is shown by the monogram IHS XPS, and the wooden
board to which the feet are <i>separately</i> attached. The Saviour is clothed in a long
tunic, with a crown on his head; above appears a hand in benediction, the usual symbol
of the first person of the Trinity. The figure below may represent the dead
rising at the crucifixion. The back ground is a copper plate in which various enamels
are embedded, to this is fixed the figure in relief, the tunic enamelled, and the eyes
formed with blue glass. The whole has been gilt.</p>

<p>This cross has been used for the face of a book cover or the centre compartment of
a shrine. Date end of the 12th century.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate17">XVII.</a> <span class="gothic">Oak Chair.</span></h3>

<p>This chair is in the Ratcliffe Room, Corby Castle, and is called <i>My Lady’s Chair</i>,
having belonged to the Countess of Derwentwater, who went over to Brussels on the
execution of her husband at the Tower 1715, and died 1723. There is an account
of it in the “Memorials of James Earl of Derwentwater, collected by H. Howard.”</p>

<p>It belongs to the latter half of the 17th century, although the ornaments have evidently
been partly borrowed from very ancient examples.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate18">XVIII.</a> <span class="gothic">Roman Plough in Bronze, and Queen Mary’s Rosary.</span></h3>

<p>This antique is curious as showing the mode of ploughing, probably introduced
into Britain by the Romans. The oxen are heavily harnessed, and there is an appearance
of bands round the inner horns of each. The right hand of the figure has
probably held a long goad. It was found at Piercebridge, Durham. The Rosary is
gold, having 110 round beads, and 11 large of filigree work, was sold in Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
by a French refugee, Captain Leger, at the beginning of the century, who claimed
to be a descendant from Melville, Queen Mary’s Secretary, and to have had the relic
with others in his family from that time. As far as internal evidence goes it belongs
to the date attributed to it. It is now in the possession of George Mennell, Esquire,
Newcastle.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate19">XIX.</a> <span class="gothic">Iron Work.</span></h3>

<p>In the absence of iron work properly belonging to the district having come under
our notice, we have given these fine specimens, belonging to the Society of Arts,
Edinburgh. They are probably of Nuremberg manufacture. The first is a bell-pull.
The second a lock-handle. The three scutcheons are for latch or key plates.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate20">XX.</a> <span class="gothic">Carved Furniture.</span></h3>

<p>This beautiful carved chest is in the possession of Mr. Grey of Newcastle. The
principal mouldings are given below the plate. The large carved settle is very bold
and rich in design.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate21">XXI.</a> <span class="gothic">Ivory Pix, or Cup with Cover.</span></h3>

<p>This very remarkable carved cup or Pix was formerly in the Museum of Mr. Allan
of Grange near Darlington, “a good lawyer and very accurate antiquary,” and was
transferred with the rest of his Museum to the Natural History Society of Newcastle.
Where it originally came from is not known, and its form and ornamentation present
difficulties in assigning a time and place to its production.</p>

<p>At the top is the Virgin and Child, and on the base towards which depend four
dead serpents, is rudely carved Daniel in the Lion’s den. It is unquestionably of considerable
antiquity, although it has been well preserved: the outer case (which fits
exactly to its shape and opens with hinges and fine clasps) being very much decayed.
This case is of wood, it has been lined with velvet and is covered outside with stamped
and gilt leather, the patterns however are nearly lost. The cup Cover is 10 inches
high.</p>

<p>In Mr. Fox’s Synopsis of the Museum it is stated that the inscription on a piece of
parchment still attached to the Pix, was partially recovered as follows. Johannes

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate22">XXII.</a> <span class="gothic">A Water Vessel of Bronze.</span></h3>

<p>Discovered near Hexham about 15 years ago imbedded in the banks of a rivulet.
The height is 13½ inches, and from the armour and the shape of the Knight’s Helmet
it would appear to belong to the early part of the 13th Century.</p>

<p>It is said to be a vessel for washing the Priest’s hands, the water being poured from
the spout at the head of the Vessel; it is possible that these Vessels are of Eastern
origin, but they seem subsequently to have been widely spread over western Europe.
Similar Vessels are in the Museum at Copenhagen.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate23">XXIII.</a> <span class="gothic">Enamelled Brass.</span></h3>

<p>This is a leaf of one of the portable diptychs or triptychs which are much used in
the Greek Church. In the upper part, which is of a pointed shape peculiar to the
east, is represented the Assumption of the Virgin; the Virgin is seated in the centre
surrounded by patriarchs, prophets, priests and Kings. Among the former Jacob
may be distinguished by his ladder. All these figures have the nimbus, which is
not confined to saints in the iconography of the Greek Church, but is also attributed
to patriarchs and others. In each of the four lower compartments, the Virgin and
child appear within a square frame receiving salutations of bishops, priests, hermits,
and saints. In the fourth are the Virgin and child also, but represented under the
form of the mystical conception. Various inscriptions of the names of the characters
&amp;c. appear on the borders, and on the labels in the hands of the figures. Above the
head of the Virgin are the monograms M θού, IC XC, (Μητηρ Θεου, Ιηδους Χριδτος.) The
strictness of the rules which were laid down in former times for the representation of
sacred subjects in Greek art renders it difficult to assign any date to objects of this kind.
Each artist has followed so closely the tradition of his predecessors that little variation
is to be found in works of periods considerably distant. The relic in question may be
either of the Greek or the Russo-Greek schools, and if of the latter it was probably
made at Kiev in Russia where the manufactory of similar objects is still carried on.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate24">XXIV.</a> <span class="gothic">Flooring Tiles. Money Box. Scold’s Cap. Rasp. Key Plate.</span></h3>

<p>1. Flooring Tiles from Fountains Abbey. These are given as showing the manner
of tesselating by tiles of various colours and forms fitting together to produce figures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>2. Small Iron Money Box. This is made of beat iron: the original is about three
times the size of the etching. It has a slit in the top, similar to the “penny pigs”
formerly common among children.</p>

<p>3. The Branks or Scold’s Cap. This instrument of punishment for scolds has been
in very general use. It was found by Pennant at Langholm in Scotland, is still to be
found at Macclesfield, and is recorded to have been used at Lichfield, Stafford, and at
Doddington, Lincolnshire. The one figured is still in the police court at Newcastle.
The nose projected through the opening in the front belt, and the spike under the
opening entered the mouth, in the vain endeavour to suppress the unruly member.</p>

<p>4. The Rasp. This instrument, the forerunner of the knocker, was formerly in
general use in Edinburgh and elsewhere. The rings hanging upon the projecting
limb were drawn rapidly up and down the surface of the iron, which in the present
instance appears to have been furnished with teeth both on the projecting part and on
that against the wood of the door.</p>

<p>5. Key Plate: is a very pretty Specimen of the 16th Century. Society of Arts.
Edinburgh.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate25">XXV.</a> <span class="gothic">Lamp pendant. French Carving.</span></h3>

<p>1. Pendant for a Lamp carved in Oak. This graceful piece of carving formerly
hung from the roof of the Hall in Anderson’s Place, an Elizabethan Mansion in which
lodged Charles I. during his stay in Newcastle, and in which took place the negotiation
between the Scotch Army and the Parliamentarians. It now serves to suspend a
Chandelier and belongs to G. Rippon, Esq. South Shields.</p>

<p>2. Is a beautiful specimen of French carving, 17th century. It has been cast in
brass lately at Birmingham, but, owing to the complexity of the parts, is expensive even
in that form.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate26">XXVI.</a> <span class="gothic">Crucifixion.</span></h3>

<p>This seems to have been an Altar piece. It is evidently of Flemish workmanship,
and is said to have come from a church in Lincolnshire. The figures are gilded.
The crosses with their figures which are now gone, have probably risen to some height
against a black or crimson ground. Some of the draperies in the German manner of
the 16th century are very well managed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate27">XXVII.</a> <span class="gothic">Stained Glass in Wetheral Church, near Carlisle.</span></h3>

<p>The Virgin and Child. This is a specimen of late English glass, probably not
much earlier than the beginning of the reign of Henry VII. There are only two
kinds of glass used, one greenish almost colourless, and the other a yellow, deepened
by the addition of the same colour. The figure is not deficient in feeling, and some
good treatment in the drapery is easily discovered. It is about 2½ feet in height.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate28">XXVIII.</a> <span class="gothic">Purse. Panel. Wall-Cupboard.</span></h3>

<p>1. The Privy Purse of Catherine of Braganza, at Sizergh, the seat of the Strickland
family. Sir Thomas Strickland was keeper of the privy purse to Catherine, till
the operation of the Test Act compelled him and other Roman Catholics to relinquish
the place. He vacated his seat in Parliament as knight of the Shire for Westmoreland
at the time of the Popish plot. Miss Strickland in her life of this Queen, thus mentions
the relic. The privy purse, the badge of his office is still preserved among the
heir-looms of the family at Lizergh. It is of crimson velvet, the size and shape of a
reticule, richly embroidered with the royal arms, and the initials C. R. in gold and
silver twist and coloured silk twist.</p>

<p>2. Panel from a chimney piece at Sizergh. Many rooms in this mansion are
covered with oak, and the chimney-pieces are of an immense size and elaboration.
They are however not in any way remarkable in general design, though occasionally
exhibiting good portions, as the one given in the engraving.</p>

<p>3. Oak Wall-Cupboard in the house of I. Y. Yeates, Esq. near Sizergh. This is
very good in general form and the lower part particularly well managed. It is comparatively
of late construction, bearing the date 1695.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate29">XXIX.</a> <span class="gothic">Carved Oak Bread Tray and Andirons, &amp;c.</span></h3>

<p>The Tray is very beautiful in its foliage: it is also at Mr. Yeates’ house, of Parkhead.
The fire plate furniture is at Levens, an ancient house with a very curious Dutch
garden in excellent preservation. The two figures rest on French scroll-work, and
seem to represent the huntsman and the student. The plate at the back of the grate
is of the same date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate30">XXX.</a> and <a class="smaller" href="#plate31">XXXI.</a> <span class="gothic">Figures of the Apostles.</span></h3>

<p>Between the piers of Carlisle Cathedral are several large oak screens placed against
the stalls of the prebends and painted on the side towards the aisles. Three of these
give a series of pictures describing each the history of a Saint. They are much decayed,
as is also the fourth which is divided into twelve compartments, filled by the twelve
Apostles. The date of these paintings is not determined, but it is conjectured that
the legends in English rhyme on the Histories of the Saints were written by Prior
Senhouse whose name occurs in 1507, and internal evidence would not assign them
much greater antiquity than 1500.</p>

<p>Over the figures of the Apostles are scrolls illuminated with the Apostles’ creed, and
the name of the Apostle over whose head each particular scroll is placed. “Credo in
Deum Patrem omnipotentem, creatorem cœli et terræ. Petrus.” “Et in Jesu Christum
filium ejus unicum, dominum nostrum. Andreu.” etc.</p>

<p>St. Simon is here represented not with the long saw usually attributed to him, but
with a great axe, if the instrument in the hand of Mathias, which is too much decayed
to be distinctly made out, has been a saw, these two saints have exchanged symbols, or
possibly the painter has named them wrong. The figures are life size or somewhat
smaller.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate32">XXXII.</a> <span class="gothic">Almeries.</span></h3>

<p>The first of these, now in Weatheral Church was removed from another parish
Church at a little distance, where it had long supplied the place of a Vestry, which
office it now fills. The other is in the little chapel called St. Catherine’s in Carlisle
Cathedral. Beside it is another of the same date which has been similarly decorated
with a border of rosettes, within each of which however we find the letters <span class="gothic">T. G.</span> in
cypher. The style of decoration is very rude. Under the terminating ends of the
hinges which seem intended to represent the heads of serpents, are remains of crimson
velvet. These letters <span class="gothic">T. G.</span> are the initials of Thomas Gondibour, Prior about 1490.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate33">XXXIII.</a> <span class="gothic">Vestry Chest.</span></h3>

<p>This very rich specimen of carving and iron work belongs to the early period of
the Renaissance, the lock being pure flamboyant tracery and canopied figures, while the
wood-carving exhibits the figures of Saints in good style divided by pilasters instead of
buttresses, and surmounted by tent-shaped instead of pointed canopies. The angels
above, who raise the hangings from the niches, also show the transition character of the
work, some of them being full draped as in earlier, and others naked as they appear in
later Italian ornament; an angel gradually changing into a cupid.</p>

<p>The upper part of the centre portion of the lock lifts up by the hinge seen above,
disclosing a keyhole, the lower part of the same portion falls down with a like purpose.
The feet of the Chest appear to have been added. The figures appear to be the Virgin,
SS. Barbara and Mary Magdalene, SS. Peter and Paul.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate34">XXXIV.</a> <span class="gothic">Drinking Vessels.</span></h3>

<p>1. The cup of Venetian Glass called the Luck of Eden Hall, preserved at that place:
the seat of Sir G. Musgrave, near Penrith. It derives its name and its careful preservation
from the tradition, that it was originally stolen from the Fairies, to whom
the legendary rhyme attached to it is ascribed:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If this Cup shall brake or fall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Farewell the Luck of Eden Hall.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The stamped leather cover is ornamented with foliage and has the sacred monogram
on the cover.</p>

<p>3. German beer Jug. This is in the Museum of Newcastle, and is stamped with
the date 1589. It has figures of David and Joshua, and coats of arms above and below
the figures, on the side represented are those of Nuremberg and Wurtemburg.</p>

<p>4. Has three figures upon it, Justice, Faith, and Patience, and the date 1566.</p>

<p>5. A Peg-tankard, in the possession of Mrs. Davidson of Ripley Hall. This species
of tankard takes its name as the reader is doubtless aware from a series of keys or
pegs projecting inside, to regulate the depth of draught allowed to each drinker as it
passed down the table. The vessel under notice holds five pints, one pint being contained
between each peg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate35">XXXV.</a> <span class="gothic">Shrine of Prior Richard, Hexham.</span></h3>

<p>The lower part of this curious little chapel has
the appearance of an altar tomb. It is however much
wider and longer and contains an interior area of
11 ft. 7 in. by 4 ft. 9 in. with access by the west end.
This small apartment is covered by a wooden roof
with painted bosses, and is open to the chancel; the
elaborate tracery on that side having no flat panelling
behind it as on the side to the aisle which our engraving
represents. Opposite the door in this miniature
Chapel is a stone altar over which have been
painted three saints, Peter, Andrew and Paul, on three
panels, with a half figure of our Saviour standing apparently
in the tomb with his hands bound, and the
instruments of the passion on either side.</p>

<p>The beautiful perpendicular tracery is so much
decayed that we give an engraving of it fully made
out, and drawn to scale by Mr. T. Gibson, architect.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate36">XXXVI.</a> <span class="gothic">Carved Oak Furniture at Sizergh.</span></h3>

<p>This fine Mansion from which we have already given some illustrations, possesses
much furniture of the description here given. The form or long seat is peculiar in style
and is one of a number, formerly in the Chapel. It has the date 1562 and the letters
W. S., the initials of the Strickland of that time, carved upon it.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate37">XXXVII.</a> <span class="gothic">Door of a Cupboard, and Carved Seat ends in the Chapel of Brougham Hall.</span></h3>

<p>This Chapel has become, for its size, perhaps the most gorgeously decorated in
England, under the direction of Mr. W. Brougham. Many rich carvings have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
collected and the whole illuminated. The cupboard or press is beside the altar and
holds the sacramental vessels. It is carved wood, and the iron hinges and the lock
have been lately gilt.</p>

<h3><a class="smaller" href="#plate38">XXXVIII.</a> <span class="gothic">Knocker. Fibulae. Celt. Spur.</span></h3>

<p>1. Great Knocker on the door of Durham Cathedral. 2. Bronze Fibula about
3 in. diameter found in the Tyne. 3. Beautiful enamelled Fibula. The original is
a third larger than the engraving. It is of brass or bronze thickly enamelled, and is
an elegant adaptation of the form of a harp to the purposes of a buckle. It was dug
up at Risington, Northumberland, 1842. 4. Ancient bronze Celt. This form of
weapon has been frequently found, but the present example is decorated with a formal
ornament, which gives it a greater value. 5. A Spur found in a morass; it resembles
the earliest form in the collection at Goodrich Court, described as Norman by Sir
S. Meyrick.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.
</div>
<div>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div id='project-gutenberg-license'>START: FULL LICENSE</div>
<h2 id='pg-footer-heading'>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</h2>
<div class='agate'>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</div>

<div>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>
<div>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>
<div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>
<div>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>
<div>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>
<blockquote>
  <div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>
<div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>
<div>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
</div>
<div>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.
</div>
<div>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>
<div>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>
<div>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:
</div>
<ul>
    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    </li>
</ul>
<div>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>
<div>
1.F.
</div>
<div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>
<div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>
<div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>
<div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>
<div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>
<div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>
<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div>
<div class='secthead'>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
